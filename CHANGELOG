0.4.0 (2014-05-22) ‘De Vorzon’
  Big release with quite a few changes:
  - (BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY) Reorganise classes into submodules.  This has
    changed the name of pretty much every class in Compo.
  - Null composites are now renamed to be Leaf composites, for consistency.
  - Add branch#find_url, as a shortcut for invoking a UrlFinder.
  - Add Compo::Branches::Constant, a Leaf branch containing a constant value.

0.3.1 (2014-05-21)
  - Add UrlFinder class, for finding children inside a composite structure via
    their URLs.
  - 100% YARD, LOC and Rubocop coverage.

0.3.0 (2014-05-21)
  - Require bundler 1.6.
  - Remove some unnecessary checks for nil: Parentless should be used instead.
    (This could be construed as a backwards incompatibility, hence the version
    bump.)
  - Factor out branch mixins into a new Branch mixin.
  - Some Rubocop fixes.

0.2.0 (2013-12-29)
  - (BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY) Implement Parentless as a null object for the
    result of calling #parent on a parentless child.  This case now returns
    an instance of Parentless, not nil.
  - #remove_child no longer exists, as Parentless calls #update_child with
    itself when a parent removes a child.
  - Numerous test improvements; now using shared examples.

0.1.5 (2013-12-29)
  - Add a missing require 'forwardable', and remove one that wasn't needed.

0.1.4 (2013-12-28)
  - Implement UrlReferenceable.  This adds two new functions, #url and
    #parent_url, which retrieve a slash/delimited/string/of/IDs starting from
    the first child in the parent chain from the caller and its parent
    respectively.
  - Include UrlReferenceable in ArrayBranch, HashBranch and Leaf.

0.1.3 (2013-12-28)
  - Implement ArrayBranch and HashBranch.  These bundle ArrayComposite and
    HashComposite up with the Movable and ParentTracker mixins, for
    convenience.

0.1.2 (2013-12-27)
  - Implement and specify #get_child.

0.1.1 (2013-12-27)
  - Avoid a function name clash between #remove_parent on a child and
    #remove_parent on a parent.  The latter is now #remove_parent_of.
    #assign_parent is now #assign_parent_to, to match.

0.1.0 (2013-12-26)
  - Initial version.
